    <h1>Better Chemistry</h1>
    <p>A dating experience built around genuine spark — not endless swiping.</p>
</header>

<section>
    <p>
        Current dating apps feel like endless swiping for mediocre matches. Even users with many
        “matches” report not feeling chemistry and not knowing how to go beyond generic prompts.
        Chemistry is what drives two people to invest time into each other, yet most apps make it
        hard to find.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although men swipe right on 40–50% of profiles (and women 5–10%), in real life people only feel
        a strong spark with about 2–3% of others. The rest may be due to desperation, habit, or validation —
        but these likes rarely lead anywhere meaningful.
    </p>

    <h2>So what creates the spark?</h2>

    <p>
        Fundamentally: looks, vibes, and personality. Current filters like height, ethnicity,
        income, or education rarely produce that “one person who feels different.” They simply
        aren’t expressive enough.
    </p>

    <h2>Our approach</h2>

    <p>
        We provide two powerful search tools:
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>1. Visual Similarity Search:</strong> Upload a picture and instantly see users who resemble the
        look or style you are drawn to. Whether that’s a celebrity, a type, or your ex — no judgment.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>2. Bio Similarity Search:</strong> Search for keywords or natural language to find users who
        match your interests, quirks, or personality traits. Want someone who plays Clash Royale?
        Loves the outdoors? Writes poetry? You can find them immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
        Other apps, like Hinge, claim to “learn your type,” but free users are limited in likes and the
        curated suggestions often miss the mark. If you already know what you want, you should not need
        to wait for an opaque algorithm to catch up.
    </p>

    <h2>Does this favor conventionally attractive users?</h2>

    <p>
        Not necessarily. Attraction is subjective, style is learnable, and personality still shines.
        Our system may actually increase opportunities for users who are less traditionally attractive
        but highly appealing to specific individuals.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even if you receive fewer likes, you get to send thoughtful messages to people who fit your type
        exactly — something no current app provides.
